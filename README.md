# The STEAM Force <br /> An open-source initiative to provide accessible and interactive education to underpriviledged kids.

Hi! My name is Snehil, and I started the STEAM Force because I believe education is a right and where you are from and where you live shouldn't be able to hinder that.

The STEAM Force is a high speed interactive web app built with Next.js and Firebase services to provide comprehensive education across the various STEAM areas - Science, Tech/Engineering, Art, and Math. It spans numerous units containing many lessons filled with interactive quiz questions.
