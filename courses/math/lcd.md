## Definition

When we add or subtract fractions, their denominators need to be same or common. If they are different, we need to find the LCD (least common denominator) of the fractions before we add or subtract.

To find the LCD of the fractions, we find the least common multiple (LCM) of their denominators. LCD can be found by two methods. In the first method, LCD of two or more fractions is found as the smallest of all the possible common denominators.In second method, we find the prime factors of the denominators. Then we look for the most occurrence of each of those prime factors and then take their product. This gives the LCD of the fractions.

## Formula 1

Here is how to find out LCD of any two fractions; for example 1/3 and 1/6:

Their denominators are 3 and 6 and the multiples of 3 and 6 are

**List the multiples of 3:** 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, ...

**List the multiples of 6:** 6, 12, 18, 24, ...

The common multiples are 6, 12, 18... The least among these common multiples is 6. So, 6 is the Least Common Denominator of 1/3 and 1/6.

## Formula 2

Here is how to find out LCD of any two fractions; for example 1/8 and 7/12:

The denominators of the fractions are 8 and 12

Their prime factorizations are

```
8 = 2 × 2 × 2

12 = 2 × 2 × 3
```

The most occurrences of the primes 2 and 3 are 2 × 2 × 2 (in 8) and 3 (in 12).

Their product is 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = 24

So, 24 is the LCD of these two fractions.
