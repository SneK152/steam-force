## Definition

Fractions that have exact same denominators are called _like_ fractions.

Fractions such as <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> and <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> are like fractions because they have a common denominator 5.

In other words, fractions with like denominators are categorized as like fractions. Performing any mathematical operations on like fractions is comparatively easier as we can make use of the common denominator for fraction operations like addition and subtraction.

## Formula for Adding Like Fractions

If fractions with same denominators are to be added, we need to add the numerators only and keep the same denominator.

- We add the numerators.
- We keep the common denominator.
- Then the Sum of the fractions = _<sup>(Sum-of-the-Numerators)</sup>_&frasl;_<sub>(Common-Denominator)</sub>_
- Sum of the fractions = _<sup>a</sup>_&frasl;_<sub>b</sub>_ + _<sup>b</sup>_&frasl;_<sub>c</sub>_ = _<sup>(a+b)</sup>_&frasl;_<sub>c</sub>_, where a, b and c are any three real numbers.

## Formula for Subtracting Like Fractions

If fractions with same denominators are to be subtracted, we need to subtract the numerators only and keep the same denominator.

- We subtract the numerators.
- We keep the common denominator.
- Then the Difference of the fractions = _<sup>(Difference-of-the-Numerators)</sup>_&frasl;_<sub>(Common-Denominator)</sub>_
- Sum of the fractions = _<sup>a</sup>_&frasl;_<sub>b</sub>_ - _<sup>b</sup>_&frasl;_<sub>c</sub>_ = _<sup>(a-b)</sup>_&frasl;_<sub>c</sub>_, where a, b and c are any three real numbers.
